# KAN-Astrophysics
KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) outperforms traditional Neural Network by its ability to derive symbolic function expressions from parameters. Given the mathematical proof in the KAN original paper, it has the ability to fit any elementary functions and their combinations, which was tested to be correct for most cases in this project.\
The interpretability KAN has shown is crucial for mathematical and physical discovery, utilizing strong computational power to generate understandable laws. The astrophysics area is therefore studied using KAN, an effort to re-discover Kepler's laws under the data of bi-stellar system generated from simulators. Further studies will focus on multi-stellar coupling, more complicated theories like Special Theory of Relativity, and farther space phenomenon like supermassive black hole in the center of our galaxy.\
